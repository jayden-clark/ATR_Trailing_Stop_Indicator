# ATR_Trailing_Stop_Indicator

This is an indicator that simulates that of a continuous trailing stop. Rather than basing the calculation off of a trade entry, this indicator is calculated using the candle close price and the average true range at that point multiplied by a number of the user's choice.
An indicator explanation can be found here:

The version that I created starts by simulating a long position ie. the indicator is calculated starting below the current close price.
